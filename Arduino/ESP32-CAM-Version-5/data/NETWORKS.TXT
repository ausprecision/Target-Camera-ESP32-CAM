SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the AP-DOS 1.00 NETWORKS.TXT file.
This file is referred to in the AP-DOS1 Concise User's Guide and refers to how
AP-DOS communicates with the hardware of your ESP32 based target camera system
hardware over wireless networks and applications existing on those network.


1. WIRELESS NETWORK COMPATIBILITY WITH AP-DOS
=============================================
1.1 AP-DOS is accessed via a telnet client running on any device that can
open up a telnet session. Telnet is available on Microsoft Windows based
operating systems, including Windows 95, 98, XP, Windows 7, Windows 10 and
Windows 11 computers.

1.2 Any client device that has built in or external wireless adapters can
connect to AP-DOS along with any ESP32 based target camera system. The main
protocols used are TCP/IP which supports Telnet, HTTP, UDP, and ICMP protocols.

1.3 For more complex target camera system environments, some customers might
have network bridges or other interfaces that run off a combination of fixed
ethernet LAN connections as well as wireless connections. As long as those
networks support TCP/IP, then then the above protcols can be accessed.
